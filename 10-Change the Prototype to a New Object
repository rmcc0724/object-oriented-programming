Up until now you have been adding properties to the prototype individually:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
This becomes tedious after more than a few properties.

Bird.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
}

Bird.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log("My name is " + this.name);
}
A more efficient way is to set the prototype to a new object that already contains the properties. This way, the properties are added all at once:

Bird.prototype = {
  numLegs: 2, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Add the property numLegs and the two methods eat() and describe() to the prototype of Dog by setting the prototype to a new object.


//Simple constructor function for new Dog object tha gets the name arg
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

//Here we add a property and methods to the prototype
Dog.prototype = {
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function () {
  },
  describe: function () {
  }
};
