/*Object Oriented Programming: Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself
There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

Notice in the example below that the describe method is shared by Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog,
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
The describe method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:

function Animal() { };

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};
Since Animal includes the describe method, you can remove it from Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
  constructor: Bird
};

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog
};

The eat method is repeated in both Cat and Bear. Edit the code in the spirit of DRY by moving the eat method to the Animal supertype.*/


//Here's a cat constructor function
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

//Here we add the constructor prop to the prototype so we don't lose the other values
Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat, 
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name; 
}

//Here we add the constructor prop to the prototype so we don't lose the other values
Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear 
};

//We will come back to this
function Animal() { }

//On the Animal prototype we added the constructor prop and the eat function so that all instances will inherit that prop
Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
   eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};
