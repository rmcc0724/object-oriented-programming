/* 
Object Oriented Programming: Set the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent
In the previous challenge you saw the first step for inheriting behavior from the supertype (or parent) Animal: making a new instance of Animal.

This challenge covers the next step: set the prototype of the subtype (or child)—in this case, Bird—to be an instance of Animal.

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Remember that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. In a way, the recipe for Bird now includes all the key "ingredients" from Animal.

let duck = new Bird("Donald");
duck.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
duck inherits all of Animal's properties, including the eat method.


Modify the code so that instances of Dog inherit from Animal.
*/
//Here we have our function constructor for Animal
function Animal() { }

//Here we set our constructor property and our eat function in the prototype
Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

//Here we have our Dog constructor function
function Dog() { }

//Here we set the prototype of Dog to the Animal prototype using Object.create()
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

let beagle = new Dog();
beagle.eat();  // Should print "nom nom nom"
